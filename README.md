# Project description

A small user administrator app, where a user can have one of two roles, the administrator or the normal user. 

Administrators can list, view, destroy, edit and create normal users. 

The detail view of a user should contain the feature to print their info into a PDF and sent the file as an attachment via email to development@taskwunder.com. 

The normal user should be able to register and authenticate. After log in, he should be redirected to a simple welcome page. The registration form should allow a user to provide their email address, full name, birth date, a small bio and optionally a profile picture to be uploaded. 
Only the normal users should be able to register, the admin should be added directly into the database.
